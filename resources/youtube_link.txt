To insert a YouTube link in a README.md file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the URL of the YouTube video you want to link.

2. Open your README.md file in your preferred text editor.

3. In the location where you want to insert the YouTube link, use the following markdown syntax:

```
[![Alt Text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID)
```

Replace `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID` with the actual ID of the YouTube video (which is usually a combination of letters and numbers found in the video URL).

4. Save your README.md file.

This markdown syntax will create an image thumbnail for your video, which will be clickable and redirect users to watch the video on YouTube when clicked.
